# News Website

This round involves you building a simple web application which fetches news articles from an external api vendor and display them in your web application

### What are we expecting ?
1. Your web application must allow the user to login
2. It must fetch news articles via news api . News api has about 70 news sources . Choose about 5 news sources and display the top 10 articles (Thier documentation explains how to query these articles)
3. Display these news sources as tiles / links in your web application and clicking on them must navigate to a screen which shows the top 10 articles . (You can be creative here . The api gives a lot of information about each article ,choose to render the most appealing information)
4. The user must be able to save the articles and there must be a button / link which allows the user to look at the saved articles (Bonus-Points)

You will essentially have 3 screens , feel free to improvise
1. Login screen.
2. Home screen with links to the news sources  and link to view saved articles.
3. Detail Screen which shows either ten news articles by source or saved articles

### Tech Stack
Choose the stack you are most comfortable with . We suggest the following
1. Backend - Node.js
2. Frontend - React
3. Database - lowdb - https://github.com/typicode/lowdb . This is simple and serves this task


### News API
1. You need to register with news api to generate an api-key and get access to thier api. https://newsapi.org/
2. Register as a developer and you should see the api-key as soon as you complete the regisration.
3. Read the documentation ,the get started link should have all the information you need for this task.
4. Make sure you add a link to news api at the footer of your screen.

### How to turn in your work ?
Commit your code in a repo in your github and add the following users as collaborators
1. marcosbozza
2. NdabaNdebele
3. adichills

Please add a readme which describes the necessary installation and how to get your web application running.
